# Wormhole NTT Connect Test

This project sets up a Vite-React TypeScript application and integrates it with the Wormhole Connect SDK.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** & **TypeScript**
- **npm** or **yarn**

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/evgeniko/example-connect.git
cd example-connect
```

### 2. Download Dependencies

Make sure to install all required dependencies using `npm` or `yarn`:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install

# Or using yarn
yarn
```
```

### 3. Adjust WormholeConnectConfig
